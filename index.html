    <p>Discipline and consistency are what I constantly strive for, no matter what I do. As a Computer Science major, I
      have
      strong foundational skills in Computer Science and Mathematics, but I still strive to achieve in all disciplines.
      I
      have made sure to maintain my 4.0 GPA throughout my college career so far, even making to the Dean's List. I have
      been playing the violin for over 12 years, winning many awards, and even going to New York to perform. I have
      volunteered at my local non-profit, VT Seva, where my team and I helped provide educational resources to poor
      children in India. I am an avid practitioner of martial arts, having earned my black belt in Tae Kwon Do and
      currently practicing Jiu Jitsu and Boxing. I look forward to further improving myself every day in my ambition
      toward success.</p>

      I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
      point," <span>Brendon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em>
      game." He lifted
      his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
      would I want to win anything other than a <emphasis>beautiful</emphasis> game?"
